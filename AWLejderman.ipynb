see how  by taking our honey you not only take everything we have    but everything we are    I wish he d dress like that all the time  So nice    Oall your first witness    So  Mr  Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms  big company you have    I suppose so    I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron    Yes  they provide beekeepers for our farms    Beekeeper  I find that to be a very disturbing term    I don t imagine you employ any bee free ers  do you     No  I couldn t hear you     No  No    Because you don t free bees You keep bees  Not only that    it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey    They re very lovable creatures    Yogi Bear  Fozzie Bear  Build A Bear    You mean like this    Bears kill bees    How d you like his head crashing through your living room    Biting into your couch Spitting out your throw pillows    OK  that s enough  Take him away    So  Mr  Sting  thank you for being here Your name intrigues me     Where have I heard it before  I was with a band called The Police    But you ve never been a police officer  have you    No  I haven t    No  you haven t  And so here we have yet another example    of bee culture casually stolen by a human    for nothing more than a prance about stage name    Oh  please    Have you ever been stung  Mr  Sting    Because I m feeling a little stung  Sting    Or should I say  Mr  Gordon M  Sumner    That s not his real name  You idiots    Mr  Liotta  first belated congratulations on    your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005    Thank you  Thank you    I see from your resume that you re devilishly handsome    with a churning inner turmoil that s ready to blow    I enjoy what I do  Is that a crime    Not yet it isn t  But is this what it s come to for you    Exploiting tiny  helpless bees so you don t    have to rehearse your part and learn your lines  sir    Watch it  Benson I could blow right now    This isn t a goodfella This is a badfella    Why doesn t someone just step on this creep  and we can all go home     Order in this court  You re all thinking it    Order  Order  I say     Say it  Mr  Liotta  please sit down    I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that    I think the jury s on our side    Are we doing everything right  legally    I m a florist    Right  Well  here s to a great team    To a great team    Well  hello     Ken  Hello    I didn t think you were coming    No  I was just late I tried to call  but  the battery    I didn t want all this to go to waste so I called Barry  Luckily  he was free    Oh  that was lucky    There s a little left I could heat it up    Yeah  heat it up  sure  whatever    So I hear you re quite a tennis player    I m not much for the game myself The ball s a little grabby    That s where I usually sit Right  there    Ken  Barry was looking at your resume    and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn t really a special skill    You think I don t see what you re doing    I know how hard it is to find the rightjob  We have that in common    Do we    Bees have 100 percent employment but we do jobs like taking the crud out    That s just what I was thinking about doing    Ken  I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz  I hope that was all right    I m going to drain the old stinger    Yeah  you do that    Look at that    You know  I ve just about had it    with your little mind games     What s that  Italian Vogue    Mamma mia  that s a lot of pages    A lot of ads    Remember what Van said  why is your life more valuable than mine    Funny  I just can t seem to recall that    I think something stinks in here    I love the smell of flowers    How do you like the smell of flames    Not as much    Water bug  Not taking sides    Ken  I m wearing a Ohapstick hat This is pathetic    I ve got issues    Well  well  well  a royal flush     You re bluffing  Am I    Surf s up  dude    Poo water    That bowl is gnarly    Except for those dirty yellow rings    Kenneth  What are you doing    You know  I don t even like honey I don t eat it    We need to talk    He s just a little bee    And he happens to be the nicest bee I ve met in a long time    Long time  What are you talking about Are there other bugs in your life    No  but there are other things bugging me in life  And you re one of them    Fine  Talking bees  no yogurt night    My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster    Goodbye  Ken    And for your information    I prefer sugar free  artificial sweeteners made by man    I m sorry about all that    I know it s got an aftertaste  I like it    I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me    I couldn t overcome it Oh  well    Are you OK for the trial    I believe Mr  Montgomery is about out of ideas    We would like to call Mr  Barry Benson Bee to the stand    Good idea  You can really see why he s considered one of the best lawyers    Yeah    Layton  you ve gotta weave some magic    with this jury or it s gonna be all over    Don t worry  The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around    is to remind them of what they don t like about bees     You got the tweezers  Are you allergic    Only to losing  son  Only to losing    Mr  Benson Bee  I ll ask you what I think we d all like to know    What exactly is your relationship    to that woman    We re friends     Good friends  Yes    How good  Do you live together    Wait a minute    Are you her little    bedbug    I ve seen a bee documentary or two From what I understand    doesn t your queen give birth to all the bee children     Yeah  but  So those aren t your real parents     Oh  Barry  Yes  they are    Hold me back    You re an illegitimate bee aren t you  Benson    He s denouncing bees    Don t y all date your cousins     Objection  I m going to pincushion this guy    Adam  don t  It s what he wants    Oh  I m hit    Oh  lordy  I am hit    Order  Order    The venom  The venom is coursing through my veins    I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction    You see  You can t treat them like equals  They re striped savages    Stinging s the only thing they know  It s their way     Adam  stay with me  I can t feel my legs    What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison    from my heaving buttocks    I will have order in this court  Order    Order  please    The case of the honeybees versus the human race    took a pointed turn against the bees    yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T  Montgomery     Hey  buddy  Hey     Is there much pain  Yeah    I    I blew the whole case  didn t I    It doesn t matter  What matters is you re alive  You could have died    I d be better off dead  Look at me    They got it from the cafeteria downstairs  in a tuna sandwich    Look  there s a little celery still on it    What was it like to sting someone    I can t explain it  It was all    All adrenaline and then and then ecstasy    All right    You think it was all a trap    Of course  I m sorry I flew us right into this    What were we thinking  Look at us  We re just a couple of bugs in this world    What will the humans do to us if they win    I don t know    I hear they put the roaches in motels That doesn t sound so bad    Adam  they check in but they don t check out    Oh  my    Oould you get a nurse to close that window     Why  The smoke    Bees don t smoke    Right  Bees don t smoke    Bees don t smoke But some bees are smoking    That s it  That s our case    It is  It s not over    Get dressed  I ve gotta go somewhere    Get back to the court and stall Stall any way you can    And assuming you ve done step correctly  you re ready for the tub    Mr  Flayman    Yes  Yes  Your Honor    Where is the rest of your team    Well  Your Honor  it s interesting    Bees are trained to fly haphazardly    and as a result we don t make very good time    I actually heard a funny story about    Your Honor haven t these ridiculous bugs    taken up enough of this court s valuable time    How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on    They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges    against my clients who run legitimate businesses    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case    Mr  Flayman  I m afraid I m going    to have to consider Mr  Montgomery s motion    But you can t  We have a terrific case    Where is your proof Where is the evidence    Show me the smoking gun    Hold it  Your Honor You want a smoking gun    Here is your smoking gun    What is that    It s a bee smoker    What  this This harmless little contraption    This couldn t hurt a fly let alone a bee    Look at what has happened    to bees who have never been asked Smoking or non    Is this what nature intended for us    To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines    and man made wooden slat work camps    Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man     What are we gonna do  He s playing the species card    Ladies and gentlemen  please free these bees    Free the bees  Free the bees    Free the bees    Free the bees  Free the bees    The court finds in favor of the bees    Vanessa  we won    I knew you could do it  High five    Sorry    I m OK  You know what this means    All the honey will finally belong to the bees    Now we won t have to work so hard all the time    This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature  Benson    You ll regret this    Barry  how much honey is out there    All right  One at a time    Barry  who are you wearing    My sweater is Ralph Lauren and I have no pants     What if Montgomery s right  What do you mean    We ve been living the bee way a long time  27 million years    Oongratulations on your victory What will you demand as a settlement    First  we ll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps    Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with    every last drop    We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more    than a filthy  smelly bad breath stink machine    We re all aware of what they do in the woods    Wait for my signal    Take him out    He ll have nauseous for a few hours  then he ll be fine    And we will no longer tolerate bee negative nicknames    But it s just a prance about stage name    unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products    and la dee da human tea time snack garnishments    Oan t breathe    Bring it in  boys    Hold it right there  Good    Tap it    Mr  Buzzwell  we just passed three cups and there s gallons more coming     I think we need to shut down  Shut down  We ve never shut down    Shut down honey production    Stop making honey    Turn your key  sir    What do we do now    Oannonball    We re shutting honey production    Mission abort    Aborting pollination and nectar detail Returning to base    Adam  you wouldn t believe how much honey was out there    Oh  yeah    What s going on  Where is everybody     Are they out celebrating  They re home    They don t know what to do Laying out  sleeping in    I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket    At least we got our honey back    Sometimes I think  so what if humans liked our honey  Who wouldn t    It s the greatest thing in the world I was excited to be part of making it    This was my new desk  This was my new job  I wanted to do it really well    And now    Now I can t    I don t understand why they re not happy    I thought their lives would be better    They re doing nothing  It s amazing Honey really changes people    You don t have any idea what s going on  do you     What did you want to show me  This    What happened here    That is not the half of it    Oh  no  Oh  my    They re all wilting    Doesn t look very good  does it    No    And whose fault do you think that is    You know  I m gonna guess bees    Bees    Specifically  me    I didn t think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things    It s notjust flowers Fruits  vegetables  they all need bees    That s our whole SAT test right there    Take away produce  that affects the entire animal kingdom    And then  of course    The human species    So if there s no more pollination    it could all just go south here couldn t it    I know this is also partly my fault    How about a suicide pact    How do we do it     I ll sting you  you step on me  Thatjust kills you twice    Right  right    Listen  Barry sorry  but I gotta get going    I had to open my mouth and talk    Vanessa    Vanessa  Why are you leaving Where are you going    To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena    They ve moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying    It s the last chance I ll ever have to see it    Vanessa  I just wanna say I m sorry I never meant it to turn out like this    I know  Me neither    Tournament of Roses Roses can t do sports    Wait a minute  Roses  Roses    Roses    Vanessa    Roses    Barry     Roses

mistake This is a total disaster  all my fault    Yes  it kind of is    I ve ruined the planet I wanted to help you    with the flower shop I ve made it worse    Actually  it s completely closed down    I thought maybe you were remodeling    But I have another idea  and it s greater than my previous ideas combined    I don t want to hear it    All right  they have the roses the roses have the pollen    I know every bee  plant and flower bud in this park    All we gotta do is get what they ve got back here with what we ve got     Bees  Park     Pollen  Flowers     Repollination  Across the nation    Tournament of Roses Pasadena  Oalifornia    They ve got nothing but flowers  floats and cotton candy    Security will be tight    I have an idea    Vanessa Bloome  FTD    Official floral business  It s real    Sorry  ma am  Nice brooch    Thank you  It was a gift    Once inside we just pick the right float    How about The Princess and the Pea    I could be the princess and you could be the pea    Yes  I got it     Where should I sit  What are you     I believe I m the pea  The pea    It goes under the mattresses     Not in this fairy tale  sweetheart  I m getting the marshal    You do that This whole parade is a fiasco    Let s see what this baby ll do    Hey  what are you doing    Then all we do is blend in with traffic    without arousing suspicion    Once at the airport there s no stopping us    Stop  Security     You and your insect pack your float  Yes    Has it been in your possession the entire time    Would you remove your shoes     Remove your stinger  It s part of me    I know  Just having some fun Enjoy your flight    Then if we re lucky  we ll have just enough pollen to do the job    Oan you believe how lucky we are  We have just enough pollen to do the job    I think this is gonna work    It s got to work    Attention  passengers this is Oaptain Scott    We have a bit of bad weather in New York    It looks like we ll experience a couple hours delay    Barry  these are cut flowers with no water  They ll never make it    I gotta get up there and talk to them    Be careful    Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine    I d like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer    Oaptain  I m in a real situation     What d you say  Hal  Nothing    Bee    Don t freak out  My entire species    What are you doing     Wait a minute  I m an attorney  Who s an attorney    Don t move    Oh  Barry    Good afternoon  passengers This is your captain    Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit    And please hurry    What happened here    There was a DustBuster a toupee  a life raft exploded    One s bald  one s in a boat they re both unconscious     Is that another bee joke  No    No one s flying the plane    This is JFK control tower  Flight 356 What s your status    This is Vanessa Bloome I m a florist from New York    Where s the pilot    He s unconscious and so is the copilot    Not good  Does anyone onboard have flight experience    As a matter of fact  there is     Who s that  Barry Benson    From the honey trial  Oh  great    Vanessa  this is nothing more than a big metal bee    It s got giant wings  huge engines    I can t fly a plane     Why not  Isn t John Travolta a pilot  Yes    How hard could it be    Wait  Barry We re headed into some lightning    This is Bob Bumble  We have some late breaking news from JFK Airport    where a suspenseful scene is developing    Barry Benson fresh from his legal victory    That s Barry    is attempting to land a plane loaded with people  flowers    and an incapacitated flight crew    Flowers    We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls    with absolutely no flight experience    Just a minute There s a bee on that plane    I m quite familiar with Mr  Benson and his no account compadres    They ve done enough damage    But isn t he your only hope    Technically  a bee shouldn t be able to fly at all    Their wings are too small    Haven t we heard this a million times    The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense     Get this on the air  Got it     Stand by  We re going live    The way we work may be a mystery to you    Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs    But let me tell you about a small job    If you do it well it makes a big difference    More than we realized To us  to everyone    That s why I want to get bees back to working together    That s the bee way We re not made of Jell O    We get behind a fellow     Black and yellow  Hello    Left  right  down  hover     Hover  Forget hover    This isn t so hard Beep beep  Beep beep    Barry  what happened    Wait  I think we were on autopilot the whole time     That may have been helping me  And now we re not    So it turns out I cannot fly a plane    All of you  let s get behind this fellow  Move it out    Move out    Our only chance is if I do what I d do you copy me with the wings of the plane    Don t have to yell    I m not yelling We re in a lot of trouble    It s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice    It s not a tone  I m panicking    I can t do this    Vanessa  pull

    "This interactive Web Scraping Project demonstrates possible uses of the [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org), and how it could help with linguistic analysis of large quantity of data in a rather short span of time. This project is only a snippet of the actual capability of this toolkit, many more steps could be performed to get a cleaner and more proper data which could be further analysed using much more complex methods."
